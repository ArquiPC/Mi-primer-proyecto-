Hi, I am a computer science student.
I'm getting started in the world of programming
This is my first project, which is designed to be a management 
software for a technical services store.
It is not finished yet, but I would like to have an opinion from people with experience, 
to know if I am doing well and what other things I could add to my project...
Grateful to everyone who can collaborate on this.
